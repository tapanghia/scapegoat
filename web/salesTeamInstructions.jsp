						<br><p style="text-align: justify;">A distribution channel is defined as the means by which the physical flow of goods
						and services are distributed to consumers and users. Such a channel is critical to large and small businesses because 
						they use them to meet their marketing and business objectives by providing and delivering products that generate profit
						and increase their customer base.</p>
						<br><p style="text-align: justify;">Distribution is important because it affects sales - 
						<span style="color:#0083C3"><i>if it's not available it can't be sold</i></span>. However good the product may be, most customers won't wait.</p>
						<p style="text-align: justify;">
						<br><p style="text-align: justify;">The sales force in MarkLABS is a combination of two input parameters:</p>
						<br><p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color:#0083C3"><i>Sales Force</i></span> - Every firm has to allocate sales 
						force in each channel and then they input the Sales Force Effort % for every brand. A proper distribution requires ample
						number of sales force. Every sales force carry same number of SKUs irrespective of the channel they cover, hence it is
						very important to allocate sales force effort % for a brand according to the buying behaviour <i>(expalined under the 
						consumer preferences in Basic Description section and the reports can also be purchased with the help of the Intelligence 
						Department)</i> of the consumers to ensure 
						proper availability of your products.</p>
						<br><p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color:#0083C3"><i>Margin Offered</i></span> - Every channel has an average
						margin requirements. Reducign the margin below the average can reduce the distribution coverage even if you have good
						number of sales force while increasing the margin can increase it. Margin affects your coverage and also your cost, so
						the firms need to decide optimally.</p>
