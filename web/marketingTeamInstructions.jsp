						<br><br><p style="text-align: justify";><span style="color:#EA463F"><i>&quot;&nbsp;The best advertising is done by satisfied
						customers.&nbsp;&quot;</i></span></p>
						<br><p style="text-align: justify;">Once you have researched appropriate projects for the segments you want to cater to, 
						you need to develop your product. You need to forecast the sales for the next period based on your expected product 
						performance and competition.  You also need to set the price for all your brands that you are marketing. The price you 
						set should be in accordance with the desired price levels of respective segments to achieve the maximum output. Now, you 
						need to advertise your product.</p>
						<br><p style="text-align: justify;">Advertisement plays a very important role in creating brand awareness and thus market 
						share for a product. It is a long-term investment and it helps to increase the market capitalization of any firm. While 
						talking of advertising, you need to take care of the following input details:
						<br><p style="text-align: justify;"><You need to allocate an advertisement budget to every brand that you market and provide the target segmentation inputs depending on 
						the segments you want to target for that particular brand. Providing target segmentation values is very crucial because you
						may be advertising on a segment that might never buy your product or you may be missing out on segments that do not buy 
						because they do not know your product.</p>
						<br><p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color:#0083C3"><i>Advertisement Media Budget</i></span> - This is a brand
						specific decision and you need to allocate a certain advertisement budget to each of your brands. You can either allot a certain equal
						amount to all your brands or else you can be differential in your allotment. This budget shall be used to purchase media space
						and time.</p>
						<br><p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color:#0083C3"><i>Creative Research</i></span> - Creativity adds beauty to 
						your advertisement. This input finances the creative work, media 
						selection, or other activities conducted by advertising agencies which improve the 
						quality of your message. In past years, companies have devoted on average 10% of 
						their total communication expenditures to creative research. Creative
						Research will usually make your advertising more effective, and is especially 
						important when you introduce a new brand or when you want to reposition an existing one. In these last two instances, higher
						percentages are recommended (in the range of 15 to 20%).</p>
						<br><p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color:#0083C3"><i>Target Segmentation</i></span> - You are required to specify
						which segment(s) you want to target to with your advertising. It makes sense to target the segment whose ideal requirements
						are close to the product you offer.</p>
						<br><p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color:#0083C3"><i>Medium Selection</i></span> - You also need to specify your advertising agencies the 
						distributon of media selection from among the four options available to you - <span style="color:#0083C3"><i>Print, 
						Television, Radio and Internet</i></span>. Each segment has different reach and perceptions regarding the mediums available, you 
						can know more about them in market research reports and then take efficient decisions.</p>
						<br><p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color:#0083C3"><i>Perceptual Objectives</i></span> - Advertising can also be used to 
						reposition a brand. Although consumers&apos; perceptions are linked to the brand&apos;s 
						physical characteristics, they can be slightly influenced by communication. But the repositioning effect is limited; this is 
						especially true when the brand awareness level is high, because a brand which consumers are extremely familiar with is 
						more difficult to reposition. Beyond a certain level, brand repositioning can no longer be done by advertising alone, and it
						therefore becomes necessary to complete an R&amp;D project. You must define
						perceptual advertising objectives for each brand. You can either choose not to advertise any objective or else you can
						choose from among the Semantic or MDS features to advertise any of your two dimensions with appropriate objectives.</p>
