						<br><p style="text-align: justify";><span style="color:#EA463F"><b>Regions Classifications</span></p></b>
						<br><p style="text-align: justify;">There are two different regions in the country MarkLABS. <span style="color:#0083C3"><i>Melhite</i></span> with
						a population of 50mn, is an urban market where people are quite familiar with all the brands. It&apos;s a growing region with some
						characteristics of a stable market. <span style="color:#0083C3"><i>Delhore</i></span> is a new and rapidly growing region with a population of 65mn,
						which was largely untapped till now. Economists believe it is going to be the major growth driver for FMCG companies in the 
						longer term. However, the products had very limited awareness till now in this region. So, your team not only has to improve
						the performance of your company in Melhite but also simultaneously pioneer successful launches in Delhore.</p>
						<br><p style="text-align: justify;">The two regions have
						similar consumer segmentation but the size in terms of population of all the segments is different for both the regions. 
						The growth rate for different segmentations is also different for both the regions.</p>
						</div>
						
						<div id="Consumer Preferences">
						<br><p style="text-align: justify";><span style="color:#EA463F"><b>Consumer Preferences</span></p></b>
						<br><p style="text-align: justify;">Although MARKLABS is a big country with a very heterogeneous mix of people, market 
						research indicates that on a broad level the consumers maybe divided into 5 major segments. Each segment has been identified
						based on their consumption behavior for FMCG products. Gender has not been considered as the product is unisexual in nature 
						and there is no significant difference between usage patters of male and female consumers. </p>
						<br><p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color:#0083C3"><i>5 people from 5 distinct segment groups have been chosen. 
						Let&apos;s read what do they have to share.</i></span></p>
						<br><p style="text-align: justify";><span style="color:#0083C3"><i>Blue Bloods</span> - &quot; I
						am Raj, son of one of the biggest industrialists of the country. Very influential people occupy all our neighboring 
						bungalows and I have developed a very good social network with their children. I believe in the concept that everything 
						good comes with a price. I prefer a very global style in whatever I eat, wear or use. I generally use only a few brands 
						that I trust and the new brand has to be really good for me to change my existing brands. Whenever I require something, 
						I just need to give the list to Ramu Kaka who gets it from the supermarkets. &quot;</i></p>
						<br><p style="text-align: justify";><span style="color:#0083C3"><i>Raffles</span> - &quot; My name&apos;s Anita and I work 
						in a senior manager in an MNC. My husband is a businessman and we live with our one and only son. As far as FMCG products 
						are concerned we always go for good brands. To me, quality of the product is very important. We love to invite our friends 
						at our house so it becomes far more important to buy good brands. Money, as you might have guessed by now, is not much of a
						problem. We typically stop at the supermarket in our locality on the way back from work to complete our purchases. &quot;</i></p>
						<br><p style="text-align: justify";><span style="color:#0083C3"><i>Wannabees</span> - &quot; Hi, I am Nikhil. I am working 
						in a top IT company for past 4 years.  I got married last year and my wife also works in an IT company. With our combined 
						savings, we just got new flat in one of the posh localities of the city. We may not be able to purchase the Armani&apos;s yet, 
						but we believe branded products are better even if the price is slightly higher. Initially, we used to purchase all our goods 
						from Mr. Lal&apos;s General Store but lately we have started buying goods from QuickShop. &quot;</i></p>
						<br><p style="text-align: justify";><span style="color:#0083C3"><i>Strugglers</span> - &quot; My name is Sunil. I belong to
						a middle class family. I work in a government company and earn just enough to support my family&apos;s basic needs. I have 2 
						children and a housewife. My parents also stay with me. Since my father has retired from public service, I have to support 
						the whole family. I plan monthly expense budget and though I cannot provide very costly products to my family, I try to look 
						for the best quality product within budget. We mostly buy products from Mr. Lal&apos;s General store as it is very close to our
						house. &quot;</i></p>
						<br><p style="text-align: justify";><span style="color:#0083C3"><i>Deprived</span> - &quot; I am Prasad. I am a daily wage earner. 
						My monthly income is Rs. 3000. I have a family of 8 and I am the sole earner in my family. I only purchase things, which are 
						necessary for my family. Also since I do not have any savings, I prefer to buy things in small volumes so that I don&apos;t have
						to incur big expenses. I donâ€™t remember the names of the brand but I do recognize the packaging of the products. Mostly 
						either my wife or me do the household purchase at the Girdhari&apos;s kirana store at the corner of the lane. &quot;</i>/</p>

						<div id="Channel Members Preferences">
						<br><p style="text-align: justify";><span style="color:#EA463F"><b>Channel Members Preferences</b></span></p>
						<br><p style="text-align: justify";>The distribution channels in MarkLABS refers to the outlets where the consumers can
						directly go and purchase goods.</p>
						<br><p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color:#0083C3"><i>There are three distribution channels available in MarkLABS.
						Let&apos;s see what do the owners of these distinct channels have to share.</p>
						<br><p style="text-align: justify";><span style="color:#0083C3"><i>Standalone Supermarkets</i></span> - &quot; I am Kamal, 
						Owner of QuickShop, one of the biggest retail chains in this region. Our motto is to provide the products at 
						the least price to our customers. We are a one-stop shop for all the needs of a family.  We cater to wide range of 
						clientele from bottom to the top of the pyramid so we need to store all kinds of products. Our margins are less but we 
						more than make up for it by the volumes. We are planning to expand to the nearby states in the next two years and become 
						a national player in the next 5 years. One major benefit we see from scaling up is the increased bargaining power we will 
						get with the manufacturers.  We frequently offer discount schemes to attract customers. &quot;</p>
						<br><p style="text-align: justify";><span style="color:#0083C3"><i>General Merchants</i></span> - &quot; I am Ratan Lal 
						and I own a general store. I store all the products of general use from groceries to cosmetics. Earlier the business used
						to be good but nowadays, some of my old customers have started buying from the newly opened QuickShop. To regain our
						business, we have recently started providing home delivery to our clients for their convenience. Many of our customers 
						are middle class people. Therefore, we are a little careful while storing costly items. &quot;</p>
						<br><p style="text-align: justify";><span style="color:#0083C3"><i>Kirana Stores</i></span> - &quot; My name is Girdhari. 
						I run a very small shop besides the street of this housing colony. I have been running this shop for last 30 years. I know
						almost all the people in this locality. Some people come and demand certain established brands, but to majority of them I 
						convince and sell local brands that provide me high margins. &quot;</p>
