						<li><br><p style="text-align: justify";><span style="color:#EA463F"><i>&quot;&nbsp;R&D is the most expensive investment that any firm makes, 
						so the investment done in R&D should be done very wisely.&nbsp;&quot;</i></span></p>
						<li><br><p style="text-align: justify;">Product is one of the most important characteristics for any 
						firm. There are five different segments in a region in MarkLABS and all of them have specific 
						needs. More details about the consumer segments and their specific perferences are detailed in the 
						<span style="color:#0083C3">Basic Description</span> section shown in the left tab. Catering to all the segments with a single product can be
						fruitless. One needs to provide an ideal product to each segment 
						to achieve the maximum return.</p>
						<li><br><p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color:#0083C3">Every product in MarkLABS has six attributes of which five can 
						be modified by conducting appropriate research projects </span><i> (the sixth is price which can be modified by the firms in any
						period whenever desired)</i>. Every attribute <i>(except price)</i> can have a value from <span style="color:#0083C3"><i>
						1-100</i></span> with 1 signifying the
						lowest possible value and 100 signifying the highest possible 
						value.The attributes that can be researched by R&D Team are:</p>
						<p style="text-align: justify;">
						<li><br><p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color:#0083C3"><i>Design</i></span> - This attribute relates to the design of the product pack.
						The ease of use of the product depends on how efficient the design is. The value 100 corresponds to very efficient 
						design and the easiest to use and preserve and similarly value 1 corresponds to inefficient design and the most 
						difficult to use or preserve.</p>
						<li><br><p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color:#0083C3"><i>Fragrance</i></span> - Fragrance is one of the most important attributes of a 
						fast moving consumer good. Often fragrance is the key parameter that stimulates trial of a new brand. 
						The input requires 
						the amount of fragrance ingredients to be added in the product. The value 100 denotes good ingredients in good 
						quantities where as 1 denotes more or less nil fragrance ingredients.</p>
						<li><br><p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color:#0083C3"><i>Persistence</i></span> - Being persistent for long denotes
						product&apo;s performance and it requires costlier ingredients and in good quantities. The value 100 denotes good 
						ingredients and in good quantity so that the product is active in providing what it claims, for a very long amount of time and the value 1 
						denotes minimal use of ingredients and almost zero persistence.</p>
						<li><br><p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color:#0083C3"><i>Packaging</i></span> - Packaging refers to the packaging material, style of packaging 
						and visual effects on the product. For any FMCG product, attractiveness is an important parameter that stimulates trial of any 
						product. The value 100 means very attractive packs with strong visual prints on the pack where as the value 1 denotes very dull 
						packs with packaging material as cheap as possible.</p>
						<li><br><p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color:#0083C3"><i>Safety</i></span> - This attribute measures the degree to which the product 
						produces few or many side effects. The value 100 is an indicator of harmless ingredients, absence of allergic reactions,
						purity, medical approval, etc where as the value 1 denotes just the opposite.</p>
						<li><br><p style="text-align: justify;">Depending on the values chosen by the firm for the above attributes, the 
						simulator calculates and gives a <span style="color:#0083C3"><i>minimum base cost</i></span>  and the <span style="color:#0083C3"><i>budget 
						required</i></span>  to conduct the research at that cost. The firms can 
						however, request to conduct research at a cost higher than the 
						minimum base cost and hence a lower budget will be required. 
						Only when the firm has a completed R&D project report, they can
						launch a product based on those specifications.</p>
						<li><br><p style="text-align: justify;">Every segment requires different attributes in their products and there
						ideal values can be read and studied by the help of the <span style="color:#0083C3"><i>Semantic</i></span>
						and <span style="color:#0083C3"><i>Multi Dimensional Reports</i></span> available under the <span style="color:#0083C3"><i>Intelligence 
						Reports</i></span> section.</p>
